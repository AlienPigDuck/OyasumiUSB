Dead Man's Switch to put your Mac to sleep

I'd like to direct you to https://github.com/kclose3/RipCord

My attempt was buggy and I don't have the skillz to make it work as I envisioned, but KClose has created a perfect working version of the idea.
I hope no-one ever needs this, but it may be a useful tool that helps someone.
